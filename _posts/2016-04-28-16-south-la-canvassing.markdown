You're invited to join your neighbors and supporters to knock on the doors of supporters and undecided
voters. We'll provide you with a script, a list of voters that you'll be talking to, and a map of where
to go. We'll also train you to use your time effectively out in the field. You'll be able to talk to
real people about how this country belongs to all of us, not just the billionaire class. Our victory
starts with us knocking on doors together.

Alfredo Gama is hosting a canvassing event in his home in South LA. This is an important opportunity to 
reach out to this district. This community is 85% Mexican/Indigenous/Classified as Hispanic. This means
that Hillary campaign is taking this community for granted. Today, many we spoke to were leaning towards
Hillary because that's the only candidate they knew. When we spoke to them about Bernie, their hearts
and minds changed. Some volunteered to canvass.

There are four seperate shifts you
can sign-up for. Two on Saturday (10am-1pm and 1-4pm) and two on Sunday (10am-1pm and 1-4pm).
