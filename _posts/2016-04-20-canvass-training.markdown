“To win this campaign, all of us must be deeply involved.” –  Bernie Sanders.
You’re invited to join your neighbors to talk about how you can get more involved with the campaign.  Your local field organizer will share our plan for winning California. Supporters like you will come together to discuss how we can grow our movement in your neighborhood. Together, we have the power to take the country back from the billionaires.
