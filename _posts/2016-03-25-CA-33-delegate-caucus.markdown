Join us in this very important political process in which we elect delegates to represent California 
District 33. It is crucial that we elect delegates who will support Bernie Sanders at the 
Democratic National Convention and fight for our cause. Please check the map below to see if 
you're a part of CA-33. 


**Eligibility:**

* Caucuses are open to registered Democrats who reside in that Congressional District.

* You may attend and vote at only one caucus (if there are multiple presidential candidates).

* If a voter is not 18, but will be a registered Democratic voter before the general election
(17 year-olds who will turn 18 on or before November 8), they are also eligible to vote.

**What to Expect:**

* Caucuses open at 1pm – you must be in line by 3pm in order to receive a ballot to vote.

* When you arrive you will sign in and cast your ballot.

* You can either stay to hear speeches or you may leave. You 
are not required to stay for the entire caucus to cast your vote.

* Voters must complete a ballot, including a public declaration that they are registered to vote as a Democrat.

* Voters can register or re-register to vote at the caucus – voter registration cards will be available.
