We need members to help with tabling. During tabling members will recuit members to 
our club, introduce students to Bernie Sanders, give information about voting, and register 
students to vote. 

There are 33,000 students at SMC that we need to reach out to, so we need all 
the help we can get.  We don't have the money to buy elections, but our power comes from the 
people. There are thousands of students at SMC that would be willing to volunteer if they had
the information. 

**We need at least FIVE PEOPLE per shift. We have 219 members on this group. 
We can do this. Just choose one, or all of them. Bernie Until the End**
