The media says we lost New York. But nothing could be further from the truth. The 
movement won New York. A state that Hillary represented as Senator for 6 years and has
a home in since 1999. A place where Wall St. Controls elections. A state where the
establishment worked to suppress the vote. It is no coincidence that more than 125,000
Democratic voters in Brooklyn were removed from voter rolls between November 2015 and 
this month. So no, we didn't lose New York. New York was stolen.There's a difference.
We already went through this feeling after Bernie's loss in the deep south. But then he 
went on to win 7 states in a row. But this was no loss. This was proof that we can still
get 45% of support (and still counting) despite all odds against us.

**New York is worth 247. Guess what? California is worth 548.**

We have to make sure we reach out to folks. We can prevent voter suppression. We can
make sure people vote. We can make sure we win. But It starts with us.
