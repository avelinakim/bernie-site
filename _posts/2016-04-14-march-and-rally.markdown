This is what democracy looks like!!! **#FEELTHEBERNLA**
This is the 4th March for Bernie LA! 10,000+ expected! Lets organize!!!
[RSVP][1]. 
We are asking for your help in making this an historic event that we can all remember, 
as well as an effective boost for the campaign! Please [donate][2]!


**COME ONE, COME ALL!!! YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED** to stand up and let your voices be heard and your 
presence felt. Stand in solidarity with the **POLITICAL REVOLUTION** happening here in Los Angeles and with 
our brothers and sisters across America, in support of our main man Bernie Sanders. We stand in unity with 
all the Sanders support groups across LA! There are no divisions; we are all one and in this together, for 
the candidacy, the presidency and beyond!

We have a fantastic day planned suitable for All Ages. This March and Rally will serve as a platform to 
inform, strengthen and mobilize our#GOTV efforts, and to recruit new voters and volunteers who will help 
ensure our campaign’s success. The March/Rally is 2 days before the crucial New York primary, so if you are 
phone banking already please be sure to continue doing so leading up to our event and after.
