Hello team!

May 23rd is going to be here before we know it. That's the last day to register to vote in order to vote in the June 7th primary here in California.
We need to step up our ground game before it's too late.
Please choose what days you can table the week of April 18.
We will table from 11am-12:30pm, when most people are out of class.
