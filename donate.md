Bernie's campaign is powered by the people, NOT Billionaires. That is why we have to work together and
contribute in any way we can. Every dollar counts... This is our movement.
Your contribution goes directly toward paying for the campaign staff who can train volunteers to knock 
on doors, make phone calls and spread the word about Bernie's message.

The average contribution to Bernie's campaign is just $27. If we all chip in, there's no limit to what 
we can accomplish together.
